# Flash Loans and Crypto Trading Execution
This project demonstrates the use of flash loans and crypto trading execution with Web3 and Hardhat, utilizing decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for price retrieval and arbitrage opportunities.

## Technologies Used
- Blockchain: Binance Smart Chain (PancakeSwap), Ethereum (Uniswap V2 & V3)
- Programming Languages: JavaScript, Solidity
- APIs: Web3.js, DEX-specific price feeds
- Framework: Hardhat

## Features
- Flash Loan Integration: Leverage flash loans for executing trades without requiring upfront capital.
- DEX Price Retrieval: Fetch current cryptocurrency prices from multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs), including PancakeSwap, UniswapV2, and UniswapV3.
- Web3 and Hardhat: Built using Web3.js and Hardhat for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

## Code Structure
- pancake.js: Contains the logic for retrieving cryptocurrency prices from PancakeSwap.
- uniswapV2.js: Implements price retrieval functionality for Uniswap V2.
- uniswapV3.js: Implements price retrieval functionality for Uniswap V3.
